# EvenPrimePair

EvenPrimePair is a Python project designed to find two prime numbers that sum up to a given even number greater than 2. This project uses the Miller-Rabin primality test to efficiently determine prime numbers.

## Features

- Efficiently finds two prime numbers that sum up to a given even number.
- Utilizes the Miller-Rabin primality test for prime checking.
- Provides benchmarking to measure the time taken for calculations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARAVIND281/EvenPrimePair.git
   cd EvenPrimePair
2. Usage

    Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python EvenPrimePair.py
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter an even number greater than 2. The script will then find and display two prime numbers that sum up to the given number, along with the time taken for the computation.

3. Example

    ```bash
    Enter an even number greater than 2: 28
    Time taken: 0.001 seconds
    The two prime numbers that sum up to 28 are: 5 and 23

4. File Description
- EvenPrimePair.py: The main script that contains the logic for finding the prime pairs.
- EvenPrimePair_pseudocode.txt: A text file containing the pseudocode for the project.
